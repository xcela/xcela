## New Learning: Augmented Exocortex

### MEMRET: Spaced Repetition
Advanced memory retention using SM4 Algorithm. Nodal-flashcard based lifelong learning.

### IR: Incremental Reader
Media consumption chunked and delivered algorithmically for deep learning and conversion into SR cards.

### ROTE: Keyboard Rote Trainer
Rapid rote memorization of keyboard interfaces and shortcuts through practice batteries delivered on a spaced repetition schedule.


## Other Notes

### scan Daemon Lookup
Lookups should take tag input, search relevant db's and return a selection of intelligently chunked sections for consumption; like many little agents running to accomplish your task.

e.g. Wikipedia, Dictionary, Thesauraus, Discogs, Archive.org,
